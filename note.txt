1) At first, there were some 'undefined function' errors when calling some of WP core functions such as add_action, wp_enqueue_style, etc. Tried to install PHP Intellisense, intelliphense stubs using composer, and some other plugins, did not work. Then stumbled upon this https://wordpress.org/support/topic/vscode-marks-every-function-as-undefined-function-function_name/, tried the solution where Benni said to "“stubs” then click on “intelephense” extension and then scroll down to bottom. Click add new item and then add wordpress.". Worked like a charm, thanks Benni!
